      <p>Welcome to my madness! I am a Coder! I love coffee and learning new things. I retired from the military and spent many years doing odds and ends things trying to figure out what I wanted to be when I grew up.  I landed on programming and real estate, with a mix of precious metals dealing also. I haven't quite figured out the real estate thing yet, but I am hoping to in the very near future.</p>

      <p>I am open to many avenues of work, as long as it keeps me thinking. I do NOT like to be bored, but sometimes it is nice to just sit back and relax.  One of these days I will be living part time in the Bahamas, and the rest of the time on my ranch (I don't have one yet, but I will).</p>
